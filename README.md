## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to work in a mobile-first workflow. When I first coded this challenge, I tested my css in my desktop browser and the result is great.
But when i tested the same css in my mobile browser, the result is very messy. Therefore, I remake the css to fit in the mobile browser first followed by the desktop browser.

In this challenge I also learned a lot of new css properties like box-shadow for giving shadow on the card and the button, and then justify-content and gap for giving some space between elements

After I completed my first challenge (3-column preview card), I feel that making the html structure for this challenge isn't as hard, but I still had difficulties on styling, especially on making the website responsive to different resolutions

In this challenge the styling is all based on feelings, but I am so glad that the result ends up great for both desktop and mobile browser

### Continued development

I believe that finishing this challenge would be useful for me in my web design & development journey because the design is commonly used. For the next development, I wanted to learn how to make the design responsive with minimal coding because all I did in this challenge was mashing up the css for both desktop and mobile browser inside the style.css file and I know that it's a waste of lines and the code can be further simplified.
